//Choose the two cells such that Anton’s total walking distance is maximized.
// total distance is moving from initial cell S so d(S,A)+d(S,B)+d(A,B).
//Intution :can't control his initial position S so first two terms can control d(A,B)
//The maximum distance between two cells in a grid is achieved only by opposite corners.
