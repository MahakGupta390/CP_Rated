//1..  If:

ai ≥ 1e9

n ≥ 1e5

sum / answer involves addition

👉 Default to long long

if ceil(b/a) then (b+a-1)/a

Bitwise AND can only remove bits, never create them.

Once a bit becomes 0, it can never become 1 again.
A bit survives in the final answer iff it is present in every element initially.
e.g 1111 & 0011 only =>0011 if '1' bit present in both then only survives.

A string’s letters can be rearranged to form a palindrome
if and only if at most one character has an odd frequency.
//5 :- cf :odd queries
// for optimisation we can use prefix sum technique

//6 :- If swaps are free, ignore order. Reduce the problem to counts. cf :-swaps and delete
